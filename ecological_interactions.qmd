## Plan for today

* Have questions?

  * Just interrupt and ask, write in chat or ask during our break. Thanks!
  
* Slides can be found here: <https://github.com/maxlindmark/pfs>

* And on Canvas

## Motivating questions

* We want to know what makes fish abundance vary through time and space...
  
  * For conservation
  
  * For sustainable management of marine resources
  
  * Because it is a basic scientific question (ecology is a young discipline!)
  

# 1. Brief recap on population ecology

## Recap

* **Population ecology**: how and why animal populations change in numbers over time and space

* **Community ecology**: how and why species abundance, composition, diversity and structure change over time and space

* **Food web ecology**: energy transfers (feeding links) between species in food webs

## Population ecology

The branch of science that attempts to describe, understand, and predict the growth (positive and negative) of animal
and plant populations

## Why do we use models?

* Capture the essence of a process so that we can generalize across systems

* Simplest representation of a population:

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"

d <- data.frame(y = 1, x = 1, family = "mono")

ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 40, stroke = 2) +
  theme_void()
```

  * What do we assume in this model?
  
## The simplest population model

Population size (numbers) at time $t$:
$$N(t)$$

Rate of change:
$$\frac{dN}{dt}$$

Per capita rate of change:
$$\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{dt}$$ 


## The simplest population model

$$r = b - d$$

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$$


## The simplest population model

* Solution to this first-order differential equation:

$$N(t)=N_0e^{rt}$$

* Exponential growth for positive $r$ and exponential decline for negative $r$


## The simplest population model

$$N(t)=N_0e^{rt}$$

```{r, echo=TRUE}
n <- 1:50
r <- 0.1
d <- data.frame(N = n) %>% 
  mutate(dNdt = r*N,
         pc_dNdt = (r*N)/N)
```

## The simplest population model

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| fig-align: "center"

p1 <- ggplot(d, aes(N, pc_dNdt)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) + 
  labs(y = "(1/N) dN/dt", x = "Population size (N)") +
  ggtitle("Per-capita growth rate", subtitle = "r=0.1")
  
p2 <- ggplot(d, aes(N, dNdt)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) + 
  labs(y = "dN/dt", x = "Population size (N)") +
  ggtitle("Population growth rate", subtitle = "r=0.1")

p1+p2
```

* Per-capita growth rates unaffected by density
* Population growth rates increase with size!


## The simplest population model

* Equilibrium?

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$$

## The simplest population model

* What's wrong with this model?

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$$

## Population regulation

* Density or density-independent factors?

* Strongly debated in the 1950's

* Any ideas for the simplest form of density dependence?



## Population regulation

## The logistic growth model

**John Graunt (1662)**

* Studied lists of births and deaths (demography) in London

* Adam and Eve: 6000 years ago... doubling time is 64 years...

* Should be *far* more people now than there is

## The logistic growth model

**Sir William Petty (1683)**

* Fool, you haven't accounted for the biblical flood!

* Reduce doubling time, change start time

## The logistic growth model

**Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus (1798)**

* *An Essay on the Principle of Populations*

  * If population grows faster than supply...
  * ... much human misery!

![](images/TomasMaltus.png){fig-align="right"}

## The logistic growth model

**Pierre-Francois Verhulst (1845)**

  * Derived the logistic equation

**Raymond Pearl** and **Lowell Reed (1920)**

  * Re-discovered it: Law of nature?

![](images/verhulst.png){fig-align="right" height=250px}


## The logistic growth model

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$$

```{r, echo=TRUE}
n <- 0:50
K <- 40

d <- data.frame(N = n) %>% 
  mutate(dNdt = r*N*(1 - N/K),
         pc_dNdt = dNdt/N)

## The logistic growth model

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$$

* How does the population grow?

* Can solve this... but also iteratively fill in $N$s'

```{r, echo=TRUE}
r <- 0.1; K <- 40; N_ini <- 2; t <- 100
N <- rep(NA, t)
N[1] <- N_ini

for (i in 2:t) {
N[i] <- r * N[i-1] * (1-(N[i - 1]/K)) + N[i-1]
}
```

## The logistic growth model

```{r}

d <- data.frame(N = N, t = 1:t)

ggplot(d, aes(t, N)) +

  ggtitle("Logistic growth curve", subtitle = "r = 0.1 and K = 40")
```

## The logistic growth model

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$$

* Another useful technique is to find the equilibria with algebra 

* Set $\frac{dN}{dt}=0$

# 2. Species interactions

## 2. Species interactions

* **Predation]**[parasitism] (-, +)

* **Competition** (-, -)

* Mutualism (+, +)

* Amensialism (0, -)

* Commensalism (0, +)

## The original predator-prey model

* Lotka-Volterra

* Published independently by Alfred J. Lotka and Vito Volterra in 1925 & 1926

* Widely used and analyzed today

![Vito Volterra](images/vito.png){fig-align="left"}

![Umberto D'Ancona](images/umberto.png){fig-align="left"}

::: {.notes}
Volterra's enquiry was inspired through his interactions with the marine biologist Umberto D'Ancona, who was courting his daughter Luisa Volterra at the time and later was to become his son-in-law. D'Ancona studied the fish catches in the Adriatic Sea and had noticed that the percentage of Selachians caught had increased during the years of World War I (1914â18), and the relative abundance of prey followed the opposite pattern. This puzzled him, as the fishing effort had been very much reduced during the war years.

## The original predator-prey model

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![](images/fish_market.png)

![](images/fish_market2.png)

:::

## The original predator-prey model

* Volterra wrote down these eqns to Umberto's:

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=\alpha N - \beta NP$$
$$\frac{dP}{dt}=\delta \beta NP-\gamma P$$

* How does the prey grow in absence of predators? How does the predator population decline in the absence of prey? What is $\beta$ and $\delta$?

::: {.notes}
1) exponentially (set P = 0 and it becomes the first growth model we looked at)
2) Also exponentially
3) Predation/attack rate and conversion efficiency
* The cost to the victim is always greater than the benefit to the enemy. 
:::

## Lotka-Volterra model

* Let's break it down

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=\alpha N - \beta NP$$

$$\frac{dP}{dt}=\delta \beta NP-\gamma P$$

## Lotka-Volterra model

* Zero-net growth isoclines

* set $\frac{dN}{dt}$ or $\frac{dP}{dt}$ = 0, break out $P$ and $N$

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=\alpha N - \beta NP$$

$$\frac{dP}{dt}=\delta \beta NP-\gamma P$$

::: {.notes}
How do we find the isoclines? what do they mean here
:::


## Prey zero growth isoclines

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=\alpha N - \beta NP$$

$$0=\alpha N - \beta NP$$
$$0=\alpha - \beta P$$
$$P=\frac{\alpha}  {\beta} $$

## Predator zero growth isoclines

$$\frac{dP}{dt}=\delta \beta NP-\gamma P$$

$$0=\delta \beta NP-\gamma P$$
$$0=\delta \beta N-\gamma$$

$$P=\frac{\gamma}  {\delta\beta} $$

::: {.notes}
This shows us that the prey increase whenever the predator abundance is below a certain value. We found that value above, and it is P=r/a. When does the predator increase or decrease? When the prey is above or below a particular value, N=m/(ea). The only time these populations are at rest is when both of these are true.

## Lotka-Volterra model

```{r echo=TRUE}
# https://strimas.com/post/lotka-volterra/
# parameters
pars <- c(alpha = 1, beta = 0.2, delta = 0.5, gamma = 0.2)
# initial state 
init <- c(x = 1, y = 2)
# times
times <- seq(0, 100, by = 1)

deriv <- function(t, state, pars) {
  with(as.list(c(state, pars)), {
    d_x <- alpha * x - beta * x * y
    d_y <- delta * beta * x * y - gamma * y
    return(list(c(x = d_x, y = d_y)))
  })
}

lv_results <- ode(init, times, deriv, pars)
```

## Lotka-Volterra model

* A cyclic model

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"

lv_results %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  gather(var, pop, -time) %>% 
  mutate(var = if_else(var == "x", "Prey", "Predator")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = pop, color = var)) +
    geom_line(size = 1.2) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
    labs(subtitle = paste(names(pars), pars, sep = " = ", collapse = "; "),
         x = "Time", y = "Population density") + 
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

::: {.notes}
Prey increase until predators are sufficiently abundant to control them, at which point they decline, leading to the decline of preadtors. The predator peaks lag behind the prey peaks
:::


## Lotka-Volterra model

* A cyclic model: phase plot

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"

lv_results %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  rename(prey = x, predator = y) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = prey, y = predator, color = time)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(subtitle = paste(names(pars), pars, sep = " = ", collapse = "; "),
         x = "Prey", y = "Predator") + 
    theme(legend.position = "bottom",
          aspect.ratio = 1/2)
```

## A famous example

* Lynx and hare data compiled by Elton^[Elton 1927]

![](images/lynx_hare.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
Changes in the abundance of Lynx (Lynx canadensis) [top] and various prey species such as Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus) are documented in records of the numbers of pelts brought into the Hudson Bay Company. Note that the Lynx cycle peaks slightly later than the hare cycle. This suggests a hypothesis that an abundance of hares feeds an increase in the number of lynx, which in turn depresses the number of hare and so on. [Unfortunately, hares also cycle in the absence of lynx]. The original data set was compiled by Charles Elton, and is notable as one of the longest time series in ecology.

## Other predator-prey models

* How can we incorporate more realism into the Lotka-Volterra model?

::: {.notes}
predator functional response, prey growth rate (numerical response), predation depending on no. predators?
:::

## Functional respose

* "Kill rate", in the LV model given by:

$$\beta N$$

* We call this a Type I functional response

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"

n <- 0:50
beta <- 0.2
delta <- 0.5

d <- data.frame(N = n) %>% 
  mutate(predation = beta*delta*N)

ggplot(d, aes(N, predation)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) + 
  labs(y = "Predation rate", x = "Prey population size (N)") +
  coord_cartesian(expand = 0) + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1/2)
```

## Other functional responses!

* Type I: $\alpha N$


* Type II: $\frac {\alpha N}{1+\alpha h N}$


* Type III: $\frac {\alpha N^c}{1+\alpha h N^c}$


## Other functional responses!

```{r, echo=TRUE}
n <- seq(0, 2, 0.1); a <- 0.5; b <- 1; c <- 3

d <- data.frame(N = n) %>% 
  mutate("Type I" = a*N,
         "Type II" = N / (b + N),
         "Type III" = N^c / (b + N^c)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(2:4)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| fig-align: "center"

ggplot(d, aes(N, value, color = name)) +
  geom_line(size = 2) + 
  labs(y = "Prey killed per predator",
       x = "Prey density",
       color = "") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

::: {.notes}
a is attack rate, and h is handling time. We refer to this functional response as a type II functional response (Fig. 8.6). As N gets really big, this fraction approaches 1/h, 

When is which FR reasonable?

Ecologists refer to this activity as “handling” and the time required to do that as handling time. Buzz Holling (1959) developed a mathematical form for a functional response with prey-dependent predation that includes handling time:

## Other numerical responses!

* I.e., the how the predators population growth rate varies with N, or dP/dt vs. N.

## Other predator-prey models

* Endless possibilities

* Let's look at the Rosenzweig and MacArthur model

## Rosenzweig and MacArthur

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=r N(1-\alpha N) - \frac{\alpha N}{1+\alpha h N}P$$

$$\frac{dP}{dt}=e\frac{\alpha N}{1+\alpha h N}P -m P$$

A damped oscillation means an oscillation that fades away with time. Eventually we will reach an equilibrium
:::

## Rosenzweig and MacArthur

* Paradox of enrichment!

![](images/paradox.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
In each case, increasing the supply of limiting nutrients or energy tends
to destroy the steady state. Thus man must be very careful in attempting to
enrich an ecosystem in order to increase its food yield. There is a real chance
that such activity may result in decimation of the food species that are wanted
in greater abundance.

## Other types of cycles...

* We have seen predator-prey cycles, but populations can also cycle for other reasons!


## Cohort-cycles

## Competition

* Interference

* Scramble / Exploitation

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![](images/scramble.png){fig-width=80%}

![](images/deer.png){fig-width=80%}
:::

::: {.notes}
Which one have we already talked about?

Male-male competition in red deer during rut is an example of interference competition within a species.

Scramble competition, occurs indirectly when organisms both use a common limiting resource or shared food item. Instead of fighting or exhibiting aggressive behavior in order to win resources, exploitative competition occurs when resource use by one organism depletes the total amount available for other organism

## L-V competition model

$$\frac{dN_1}{dt}=r_1N_1(\frac{K_1-N_1-\alpha_{12}N_2}{K_1})$$
$$\frac{dN_2}{dt}=r_2N_1(\frac{K_2-N_2-\alpha_{21}N_1}{K_2})$$

alpha12 expresses the effect of one member of Population 2 on the growth rate of Population 1
alpha21 expresses the effect of one member of Population 1 on the growth rate of Population 2.

## L-V competition model

* Find the zero-growth isocline for species $N_1$

$$\frac{dN_1}{dt}=r_1N_1(\frac{K_1-N_1-\alpha_{12}N_2}{K_1})$$
$$0=r_1N_1(\frac{K_1-N_1-\alpha_{12}N_2}{K_1})$$

$$0=\frac{K_1-N_1-\alpha_{12}N_2}{K_1}$$

$$N_1=K_1-\alpha_{12}N_2$$

:::{.notes}
The equilibrium is the population size at which the population stops growing. We can solve for this equilibrium by setting dN/dt for each species to zero and solving for N.

* Find the zero-growth isocline for species $N_2$

$$\frac{dN_2}{dt}=r_2N_1(\frac{K_2-N_2-\alpha_{21}N_1}{K_2})$$

$$N_2=K_2-\alpha_{21}N_1$$

## Mathematical or statistical?

![](images/whynotboth.png){fig-align="center"}
::: {.notes}
Many of these models are based upon statistical techniques and are good at assessing the current state and making short-term predictions; however, as they do not model interactions between stocks, they lack predictive power on longer timescales. Additionally, there are size-based multi-species models that represent key biological processes and consider interactions between stocks such as predation and competition for resources. Due to the complexity of these models, they are difficult to fit to data, and so many size-based multi-species models depend upon single-species models where they exist, or ad hoc assumptions when they do not, for parameters such as annual fishing mortality.
