# Who are you ... ?

---

# Plan for the 4-session lecture on Ecological interactions and Dynamics

* 1: Brief recap on population dynamics

* 2: Species interactions!

* 3: How can we quantify species interactions?

* 4: How are species interactions included in fisheries research?

# Plan for the 4-session lecture on Ecological interactions and Dynamics

* Have questions?

  * Just interrupt and ask, write in chat or ask during our break. Thanks!

---

# Motivating questions

* We want to know what makes fish abundance vary through time and space...
  
  * For conservation
  
  * For sustainable management of marine resources
  
  * Because it is a basic scientific question (ecology is a young discipline!)

# Recap

* **Population ecology**: how and why animal populations change in numbers over time and space

* **Community ecology**: how and why species abundance, composition, diversity and structure change over time and space

* **Food web ecology**: energy transfers (feeding links) between species in food webs

```{r}

N[i] <- r * N[i-1] * (1-(N[i - 1]/K)) + N[i-1]

# 2. Species interactions
* Mutualism

* Commensalism

* **Predation**

* **Competition**

# Predation

```{r big fish, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Big fish eat small fish", out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/big_fish.png")
```

# Competition

* Scramble / Exploitation

* Already touched briefly on intraspecific interactions

```{r interspecific competition, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Interspecific competition", out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/competition.png")
```

# 3. Quantifying species interactions in natural systems

* Diet data

* Abundance data (e.g., from scientific trawl surveys)

* Apply statistical models

---

* Carrol paper?

* Neuenfeldt paper?

* Casini trophic cascade paper?

---

# 4. Species interactions in fisheries research
* Statistical / Mathematical approaches

---

# In stock assessment
* Natural mortality

* SMS model

---

# Food web models for strategic advice

* Based on "first principles"

* Ken Andersen
